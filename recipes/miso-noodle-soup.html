    <h3 class="heading">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the spring onion. Place the grated ginger and white parts of the spring
            onion into a saucepan. Saut&eacute; for a few minutes over low heat. Reserve the green parts of the spring onion
            fir garnish.
        </li>
        <li>Add the miso paste, peanut butter and water to the saucepan. Simmer gently under a lid for
            10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Press the tofu using paper towels or a clean kitchen towel, then cut it into cubes.
            If desired, fry the tofu in oil until golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse the bok choy. Separate the leaves and, if necessary, cut the largest leaves into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>Add the tofu, bok choy and noodles to the broth. Cook for 4-5 minutes until the noodles are tender
            and the bok choy has softened slightly. Finally add the remaining spring onion. Serve the soup with crispy
            garlic in chili sesame oil.
        </li>
    </ol>
