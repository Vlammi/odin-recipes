            the beans cool down.
        </li>
        <li>Take the tofu and cut it into small cubes, then place it in the airfryer for 15 minutes at 180 &deg;C (356 &deg;F).
            Let the cooked rice cool down. 
        </li>
        <li>Place the rice at the bottom of the plate, and arrange the vegetables and fruits in separate sections
